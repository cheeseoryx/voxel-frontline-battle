# SSR dependency fallback evidence

This directory records the paired dependency evidence for the reflection fallback
consumer. It does not claim that SSR v1 is implemented. The parent SSR admission
remains fallback-only until the producer, format, temporal, and identity receipts
are all present and matched.

## Progressive discovery

The first layer answers whether evidence is admissible:

| Field | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `status` | `pass` means this lane completed; `blocked` means it cannot be admitted |
| `identity` | source HEAD/tree, lock hash, and built render hash bound to the run |
| `lane` | `browser` or `dawn`; the lanes are paired and cannot substitute for one another |
| `expectations[].verdict` | per-expectation result, with `observed` and bounded `confidence` |

The second layer is the producer evidence embedded in the fixture report: source
selection (`local-probe`, `skylight`, or `neutral`), generation and lifecycle facts,
candidate invisibility, submit-failure handling, device recovery, c=0/c=1, and the
complete r32float profile. These are observations, not a second owner or ledger.

The bottom layer is directly retrievable evidence:

| Lane | Manifest | Detached input | Readback | Validation log |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| Browser | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/browser/manifest.json` | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/browser/ssr-dependencies-input.json` | `.forgeax-debug/<runId>/live.png` | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/browser/validation.log` |
| Dawn | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/dawn/manifest.json` | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/dawn/ssr-dependencies-input.json` | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/dawn/frame.png` | `artifacts/ssr-fallback/dawn/validation.log` |

The schemas are lane-specific but intentionally require the same identity,
fixture revision, 300-frame execution, readback, PNG, thresholds, and expectation
shape:

- `browser/manifest.schema.json`
- `dawn/manifest.schema.json`

The execution thresholds are frozen before reading pixels: linear HDR absolute
error `<= 0.05` and HDR luma relative error `<= 0.02`. Pixel readback is supporting
evidence; structured producer and receipt facts remain the admission source.

## Visual reading record

After collecting each PNG, record one row per expectation without inferring facts
from a filename, array position, or page liveness:

```json
{
  "id": "candidate-invisibility",
  "observed": "candidateVisible=false before completion",
  "verdict": "pass",
  "confidence": 0.8
}
```

If a locator cannot be read, use `blocked` and retain the exact path and reason.
Do not replace a missing Browser or Dawn run with a screenshot from the other lane.
The three falsification variants live in `apps/learn-render/6.pbr/4.render-target-reflection/scripts/falsification.mjs`;
they are dev-only failures and must never be copied into a passing manifest.

## Public recovery boundary

The public render route is `inspect -> report locator -> closed error -> owner
recovery -> matching submit -> reinspect`. A report is one joint dependency
projection; it is not a second owner or ledger. Consumers receive detached facts,
never live texture, buffer, encoder, graph, or device handles. Missing or mismatched
receipts keep the parent SSR consumer at `fallback-only` with zero SSR work.

This evidence package does not implement SSR v1, Hi-Z, ray marching, temporal
resolve, composition, or history. `structural-only`, page liveness, a single lane,
RhiNull output, or a screenshot cannot replace paired Browser and Dawn evidence.
