# Collectathon — Direct-Fix Progress

> 2026-06-27. The user exited the closed-loop at the verify(reEntry) step and switched
> to **direct iterative fixing**. This doc tracks the hands-on fix work from here on.
> Why the switch: the M6 boot-e2e gate (zero console errors + drawCalls>0) passed, but a

## How we got here (closed-loop history, abbreviated)

- Full 7-step loop ran to judgment; verify round-2 "approved" on a single sandbox screenshot.
- **Human rejected at judgment** — `pnpm dev` crashed on launch (`render-system-no-camera`).
- Re-plan added **M6**: a real dev-server boot e2e gate + fixes for 3 startup defects.
- M6 spike found R-13 was actually **3 engine debug-draw bugs** (glue-split stub / PSO format /
  GPU vbo growth) — all in a browser debug-draw path that had never executed. Human authorized
  the engine fixes (`packages/runtime` + `packages/debug-draw`). All landed, CI 11/11 green.
- verify(reEntry) round 5: VerifyUnifiedReviewer + Pure both **approved** (boot e2e PASS,
  drawCalls=8111, 3 crash signatures = 0, no regressions).
- **Human played the running game and reported the defects below.** Loop abandoned here in
  favor of direct fixing. (Sandbox verify agent stopped mid-run; no further loop artifacts written.)

## Reported defects (from the live playthrough — the source of truth now)

All observed in the browser at `http://localhost:5173/` (dev server, `?debug=1` default).

| # | Symptom (as reported) | Suspected area (UNVERIFIED — reproduce first) | Status |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| D1 | 角色渲染和动画"乱七八糟" / 角色很怪 | **ROOT CAUSE: ground plane was a vertical wall occluding the character** (see below) | **FIXED** |
| D2 | 角色总是在往前跑（停不下来 / 一直播放 run 动画或一直位移） | **facing: `moveAndSlide` writes back position only, never rotation → parent quat stuck at identity. Fix: write a yaw quat from the planar move dir in player-move. Idle/run crossfade weights confirmed settling [0,1]<->[1,0].** | **FIXED (visually verified)** |
| D3 | 角色跟绿色调试球不在一块（debug sphere 位置与角色脱节） | SAME root cause as #18 (`hierarchy-broken` every frame froze + detached the rig). Once propagate stopped throwing, the child rig world derives from the parent correctly — player/sceneRoot/skin share the parent world translation. No root-motion stripping needed. | **FIXED (visually verified)** |
| D4 | 屏幕分辨率很低 | canvas backing-store size vs CSS size / devicePixelRatio not applied; index.html canvas sizing | **FIXED** |
| D5 | 背景有个很怪的墙 + 怪异遮挡关系 | **SAME root cause as D1: createPlaneGeometry ground not rotated → stood as a wall** | **FIXED** |
| D6 | 道具无法收集 | **TWO causes: player collider collisionGroups=0 (overlaps nothing) + missing CollidingEntities component (writeback skips it); compounded by the engine hierarchy-broken stalling the schedule.** Fixed in spawn-player.ts + the `packages/state` engine fix. Verified: walked onto core → SCORE 0/12→1/12. | **FIXED** |
| D7 | 左右移动方向与实际相反 | player-move input->world axis mapping (camera-relative basis sign), or camera yaw inversion | **FIXED** |
| D8 | 整体场景"很怪" | umbrella — resolved by D1/D5/D4 + the two engine fixes; re-evaluate after a fresh playthrough | resolved |

## D1 + D5 ROOT CAUSE (FIXED 2026-06-28)

**Both D1 (character invisible) and D5 (weird wall) were the SAME bug.** `spawn-level.ts spawnGround`
used `createPlaneGeometry()` **without rotating it**, with a comment that wrongly claimed "lies in the
XZ plane already". In truth `createPlaneGeometry(w,h)` produces an **XY plane facing +Z** (Three.js
r184 convention — see the doc comment in `packages/runtime/src/geometry/plane.ts` and the vertex data
`z=0, normal=(0,0,1)`). So the "ground" was a **30×30 vertical wall** standing at z=0 facing the +Z
camera — it was both the "weird wall" the user saw (D5) AND the occluder hiding the character (D1),
which sits at z≈-2.8 behind the wall.

**Fix** (`apps/collectathon/src/spawn/spawn-level.ts`): rotate the visible plane -90° about X to lay it
flat (`quat=[sin(-π/4), 0, 0, cos(-π/4)]`, the canonical floor idiom from
`apps/learn-render/5.advanced-lighting/3.3.csm`). The visible plane and the physics cuboid collider are
now **separate entities** (`spawnGroundVisual` + `spawnGroundCollider`) because the -90° rotation must
NOT apply to the (15, 0.5, 15) collider (it would stand it up as a vertical slab and break KCC contact).
Smoke `smoke-dawn.mjs` ground replica synced with the rotation (kept as one entity for count fidelity).

Also kept: a vivid **cyan skin material override** on the player (the FBX default grey is invisible
against the grey level). Browser smoke entityCount 112→113 (ground split +1, still within [100,130]).

**Diagnosis path** (why it took long): position bisection showed the char renders when moved far from
origin (y=200 OR z=-300) but vanishes at the game position near origin; deleting `spawnLevel` made it
appear instantly → pure geometric occlusion, not material/scale/skinning (all CPU-side state verified
correct: palette `M_i=jointWorld·IBM`, scale 1/90, winding det>0, draw issued every frame, 0 errors).

**Falsified theories** (don't revisit): skin two-pass / fs_gbuffer (URP never uses deferred), scale
coupling (scale is fine), skin variant-key hardcoding (fallback compiles correct WGSL, benign), empty
mesh AABB (`computeAABB` reads `attributes.position` but interleaved FBX meshes store positions in
`vertices` → inverted-infinity box → cull treats as always-visible, benign; the reference fbx-skin
renders the same mesh with the same empty AABB).

**Latent engine bug (NOT fixed here, low severity):** `computeAABB`
(`packages/runtime/src/asset-registry.ts`) only reads `asset.attributes.position`; for interleaved
meshes (position packed in `vertices`, stride 12F/18F) it always returns an empty AABB, so those meshes
never participate in frustum culling. Functionally "always visible" so not urgent, but cull is silently
disabled for every interleaved/skinned mesh. Worth a follow-up engine fix.

> [!CAUTION]
> Per systematic-debugging: **symptom != diagnosis**. The "suspected area" column is an

## Fix protocol (direct mode)

1. Keep one dev server running (`apps/collectathon` `pnpm dev`, bg). Use playwright to drive +
   screenshot for each defect (the `playwright-cli` skill is available).
2. Reproduce -> root-cause -> minimal fix -> re-screenshot to confirm -> next defect.
3. Group related defects (e.g. D4 resolution is likely one canvas-sizing fix; D3+D2 may share a
   pose/anim root cause).
4. Run `pnpm -F @forgeax/collectathon smoke:browser` + dawn smoke after a batch; keep them green.
5. Engine vs demo: D6 (collect) + D3 (pose) could be demo OR engine. Confirm before touching
   `packages/**`; engine edits are already human-authorized for the debug-draw path only —
   any NEW engine area needs a fresh OK.

## Engine changes already on this branch (do not regress)

- `packages/runtime/src/debug-draw-glue.ts` — glue merged into main barrel; PSO format from
  `selectSwapChainFormat(...).view` (Bug A).
- `packages/debug-draw/src/debug-draw.ts` — GPU vbo reallocates on capacity growth (Bug B).
- `packages/runtime/{tsup.config.ts,index.ts,package.json}` — `./debug-draw-glue` subpath export
  removed; single module instance.
- `packages/app/src/create-app.ts` — imports `createDebugDrawOnReady` from main barrel.
- `packages/physics-rapier3d` — `CollidingEntities` populate (round-1, earlier authorization). **D6
  may relate to this — verify it actually populates at runtime.**

## Branch / state

- Branch: `forgeax/feat-20260626-3d-third-person-collectathon-showcase-game`
- HEAD at switch: `093b143375`
- PR #543 open (do not merge until defects fixed).
- Loop state file still says `verify`; left as-is (no further transitions — we're off-loop now).

## Root-cause findings (2026-06-27 investigation, layered-gate protocol)

Method: ran the dev server + Playwright `Read(image)` (orchestrator reads PNGs), exposed a
`globalThis.__dbg` introspection hook (live transforms / scene-graph walk / camera POD), and
compared against the **reference** `apps/hello/fbx-skin` demo (same humanoid.fbx) served on :5199.

| # | Verified root cause | Evidence |
|:--|:--|:--|
| D4 | Canvas backing store stuck at HTML default **300x150**, CSS-stretched to viewport. Engine reads `canvas.width` and never auto-resizes; the demo must size it. | `canvas.width/height` readback = 300x150 pre-fix, 1280x720 post-fix |
| D7 | `cameraPlanarBasis` returns `right = (fwdZ, 0, -fwdX)` — the **negated** camera-right. Correct is `cross(fwd, up) = (-fwdZ, 0, fwdX)`. | math: camera fwd=(0,0,-1) -> code gives right=(-1,0,0) i.e. -X; correct is +X |
| D1/D3 | Character renders **grey-on-grey** (FBX default grey material vs grey ground+skybox). Engine path is fine — the **same FBX renders correctly in fbx-skin** (grey on teal). Character casts a clean humanoid shadow; only blends into the background. | `/tmp/ref-fbxskin.png` (3 lit characters) vs collectathon center crop (grey blob + shadow); ent 27 has MeshRenderer+MeshFilter+Skin all present at world origin |
| D2 | (a) "idle" slot = run clip **held at speed 0** = frozen mid-run pose, so standing still looks like running; (b) the rig **never yaws to face movement direction** — player-move only translates the parent. | player-anim.ts slot model; player-move.ts writes position only, no rotation |

Player parent is **static** at (0, 0.8, 0) in a no-input probe — D2 is a pose/orientation issue,
not positional drift. Camera POD is clean (fov pi/4, aspect 16:9, autoAspect, no roll/yaw).

## Log (append per fix)

- 2026-06-27: switched to direct-fix mode; wrote this doc; defects D1-D8 captured from playthrough.
- 2026-06-27: **D4 FIXED** — added dpr-aware `resizeCanvasToDisplaySize` in main.ts (mirrors hello/skin); backing store 300x150 -> 1280x720, verified crisp.
- 2026-06-27: root-caused D7 (camera-right negated) + D1/D3 (grey-on-grey, engine fine per fbx-skin reference) + D2 (frozen-run idle + no facing yaw).
- 2026-06-27: **D7 FIXED** in player-move.ts (`planarBasisFromForward` extracted + corrected to `right=(-fwdZ,0,fwdX)`, +3 unit tests). Verified A/D maps correctly in hello/character reference (D->+X).
- 2026-06-27: **NEW ENGINE BUG found (was hiding D7 + D2): multi-KCC `moveAndSlide` corruption.**
  - Symptom: the player KCC moves exactly ONE frame then `computeColliderMovement` returns 0 forever (player frozen at x=0.066). Jump (vertical) still works.
  - Isolation (live probes, dev server): with **guardians removed** the player moves continuously (0->2.4->6.9->10.3->12.7->14.7). With **even ONE guardian present** (a second KCC entity) the player jams after one frame -- regardless of whether the guardian actually moves (disabling guardian-ai's moveAndSlide did NOT help; removing the guardian entity entirely DID).
  - Conclusion: a SECOND `KinematicCharacterController` in the same Rapier world corrupts the first's `computeColliderMovement`. collectathon is the engine's FIRST multi-KCC scenario (hello/character has 1 KCC; no test/demo has 2+), so this gap was never hit.
  - Suspect: `RapierPhysicsWorld3D.computeMove` calls `world.propagateModifiedBodyPositionsToColliders()` (a GLOBAL op) after every moveAndSlide, but the KCC query structures used by `computeColliderMovement` are not refreshed per-controller; multiple movers desync the shared broad/narrow-phase the next compute reads. Engine file: `packages/physics-rapier3d/src/rapier-physics-world-3d.ts` (computeMove ~L390-440).
  - **This is an ENGINE fix in `packages/physics-rapier3d`, outside the debug-draw authorization. Needs explicit user OK before editing packages/**.** Until fixed, D2 (facing yaw) can't be visually verified (player can't move), so D2 is parked behind it.
  - This also explains the user's "角色总是在往前跑": the rig is frozen in a mid-run idle pose AND can't actually move, so it reads as "always running but going nowhere".
- 2026-06-28: **ENGINE BUG ROOT-CAUSED + FIXED (user authorized).** It was NOT a generic multi-KCC
  corruption -- it was the KCC treating **sensor colliders as solid walls**. Mechanism:
  - The guardian *attack sensor* spawns with `ChildOf(body)` but `Transform.local = (0,0,0)`. ChildOf
    drives the rendered `world` matrix via propagateTransforms, but the **physics** body position
    comes from `syncBackend` reading the local `Transform.pos` -- which stays (0,0,0). So all 3
    guardian sensors sit at physics **world origin = the player spawn**.
  - `moveAndSlide` -> Rapier `computeColliderMovement` filtered only self-by-handle, so it treated the
    overlapping sensors as solid -> the player was walled in on all axes (correctedX/Y/Z all 0).
  - Reproduced as a unit test (sensor sphere on the character spawn freezes it at x=0.1); the bug was
    invisible before because collectathon is the engine's first KCC-overlapping-a-sensor scenario.
  - **Fix** (`packages/physics-rapier3d/src/rapier-physics-world-3d.ts`): pass
    `RAPIER.QueryFilterFlags.EXCLUDE_SENSORS` to `computeColliderMovement` -- the canonical Rapier way
    to make a KCC ignore non-solid trigger volumes. +2 regression unit tests. All 42 physics tests green.
  - **Browser-verified**: player moves continuously (0->2.56->7.36->12.15->14.69, stops at the x~15
    boundary wall) and **D7 confirmed** (D -> +X screen-right).
  - Follow-up (demo, not engine): the guardian attack sensor never tracks its body in physics (ChildOf
    is render-only). guardian-hit overlap detection is therefore also broken -- the sensor sits at
    origin forever. Must reposition the sensor body each frame (or attach it to the body's physics
    transform). Parked under the guardian/collect work.
- 2026-06-28: **D1 + D5 FIXED (same bug, demo-side).** Root cause: `spawn-level.ts spawnGround` used
  `createPlaneGeometry()` WITHOUT rotating it -- but that factory makes an **XY plane facing +Z**
  (Three.js r184; the old comment "lies in the XZ plane already" was false). So the ground was a
  30x30 **vertical wall** at z=0: it was both the "weird wall" (D5) and the occluder hiding the
  character at z~-2.8 (D1). Fix: rotate the visible plane -90deg about X (`quat x=sin(-pi/4),
  quatW=cos(-pi/4)`, canonical floor idiom from learn-render/5.3.3 csm); split ground into
  `spawnGroundVisual` (rotated plane) + `spawnGroundCollider` (axis-aligned cuboid, must NOT rotate or
  the floor stands up). Kept a cyan skin material override (FBX grey is invisible vs grey scene).
  Synced `smoke-dawn.mjs` ground replica (rotation added, kept 1 entity for count fidelity).
  - Diagnosis: position-bisection -- char renders far from origin (y=200 OR z=-300), vanishes at game
    position; deleting `spawnLevel` made it appear instantly -> geometric occlusion, not skinning.
  - **Verified**: browser screenshots show char + flat floor + shadows; dawn smoke PASS (300 frames,
    entityCount=28, 0 err); browser smoke PASS (entityCount 112->113, drawCalls 7210, 0 SUT err);
    78 collectathon unit + 42 physics tests green; typecheck + biome clean. All DBG instrumentation
    removed; the earlier g-buffer/scale/fs_gbuffer/`__skinDbg`/`__dbg` debug edits reverted.
  - **Latent engine bug logged (NOT fixed, low severity):** `computeAABB` (asset-registry.ts) reads
    only `attributes.position`; interleaved meshes (position in `vertices`, stride 12F/18F) get an
    empty AABB -> never frustum-culled. "Always visible" so benign, but cull silently disabled.
- 2026-06-28: status now D1/D4/D5/D7/D8 FIXED; D2 (frozen-run idle + no facing yaw), D3 (run-clip root
  motion offsets skeleton ~2.8u Z from KCC capsule), D6 (props uncollectable) remain open.

## [FALSIFIED — superseded by §"D1 + D5 ROOT CAUSE" above] D1: skinned mesh has no deferred/g-buffer pass (HDRP)
> This whole section is WRONG: the app runs URP (never HDRP), so g-buffer is irrelevant. Kept as investigation record only.

2026-06-28. After movement was fixed, the character is STILL invisible (only a clean humanoid
**shadow** renders at the green debug-sphere = player position). Investigated with the layered-gate
protocol + the fbx-skin reference.

### Findings (each verified)
- The skinned mesh entity (the Skin-bearing descendant) has MeshRenderer + MeshFilter + Skin, sits at
  world origin co-located with the player -- so D3 ("not with the green sphere") was really the
  movement bug; the character IS at the player. Not a placement bug.
- The **same humanoid.fbx renders perfectly in `apps/hello/fbx-skin`** (grey, lit, animated, on teal).
  So the engine skinned-mesh path is fine *in the forward pipeline*.
- The character casts a correct humanoid **shadow** but is invisible in the **color** pass -- classic
  "renders in depth/shadow, not in color" signature.
- Root cause: collectathon runs the **HDRP deferred pipeline**, which renders opaque geometry via a
  **g-buffer pass** (`passKind='deferred'`, fragment `fs_gbuffer`) and runs the forward pass only for
  alpha-blended/transparent geometry. The skin shader `forgeax::pbr-skin`
  (`packages/shader/src/default-standard-pbr-skin.wgsl`) has **only `vs_main` + `fs_main` (forward)** --
  NO `fs_gbuffer`. So skinned meshes are never drawn in HDRP's opaque g-buffer pass. `Materials.standard`
  (used by ground/portal/cores) DOES declare a `deferred` g-buffer pass, which is why those render.
- Confirmed NOT post-processing: disabling bloom/tonemap on the Camera did NOT make the character
  appear -- HDRP stays active (forced by Skylight / cluster-lighting, not by the post FX), so dropping
  bloom alone does not switch to the forward pipeline.

### Material-shader gotcha hit on the way
- Replacing the skin material with `Materials.standard()` (to recolor the grey character) caused a
  flood of `SkinMaterialMismatchError: expected forgeax::pbr-skin, got forgeax::default-standard-pbr`.
  A skinned mesh entity fail-fasts unless its material's shader is `forgeax::pbr-skin`. Recolor must be
  a hand-built MaterialAsset with the `forgeax::pbr-skin` pass (cyan baseColor) -- that cleared the
  errors but the mesh is still invisible for the g-buffer reason above.

### Decision needed (two paths; both are real work)
1. **Engine fix (correct, larger):** add a deferred/g-buffer pass to the skin shader
   (`default-standard-pbr-skin.wgsl` gets an `fs_gbuffer` entry + pipeline registration so
   `passKind='deferred'` skin PSOs exist), then give the player material both deferred + forward + shadow
   passes like `Materials.standard`. Makes skinned characters first-class in HDRP. Touches
   `packages/shader` + `packages/runtime` PBR pipeline -- needs user authorization + careful smokes.
2. **Demo path (smaller, possibly a workaround):** switch collectathon to the **forward** pipeline
   (where skin already renders, per fbx-skin) and drop/********approximate IBL+bloom there. Cheaper but
   loses the HDRP showcase the demo was built around, and AGENTS.md warns against demo-side workarounds
   for engine gaps.

Current debug state of the tree: camera post-processing temporarily stripped + player given a cyan
`pbr-skin` material override (both still in main.ts/spawn-player.ts as of this note); both must be
revisited once the path is chosen.

### Deep-dive conclusion (2026-06-28): the engine fix is small + well-scoped

Traced the HDRP draw path end-to-end. The fix is bounded:
- **Fragment entry is data-driven from the MaterialPass**, NOT hardcoded per shader id.
  `render-system-extract.ts:2727` builds dispatch entries from the material's own `passes[]` via
  `selectPasses`, threading each pass's `fragmentEntry` + `tags.LightMode` into the dispatch entry
  (lines 2742/2738). The g-buffer pass runs `recordMainPass(ctx, {LightMode:['Deferred']})`
  (`hdrp-pipeline.ts:351`) and the PSO is keyed on `(shaderId, ..., passKind)` -- the same draw loop
  already binds the skin group(2) palette BG (`render-system-record.ts:5322/5524`).
- So a skinned mesh will render in the HDRP g-buffer pass IF: (a) the skin WGSL has an `fs_gbuffer`
  entry, and (b) the material declares a `passKind:'deferred', fragmentEntry:'fs_gbuffer'` pass.
- **Shadows already work** for the skinned char via the engine's separate shadow render pass
  (`forgeax::default-shadow-caster`, depth-only) -- the player material does NOT need a shadow pass.

**Scoped engine change (2 edits):**
1. `packages/shader/src/default-standard-pbr-skin.wgsl`: add the `GBufferOutput` struct + an
   `fs_gbuffer` fragment entry. The body is byte-identical to `default-standard-pbr.wgsl`'s
   `fs_gbuffer` (skin VsOut already carries worldPos / worldNormal / worldTangent / uv); only the
   vertex stage differs (skinning), which `vs_main` already does. ~25 lines, no new bindings.
2. `apps/collectathon/src/spawn/spawn-player.ts`: give the player material two passes -- deferred
   (`fs_gbuffer`) + forward (`fs_main`) -- both shader `forgeax::pbr-skin`, mirroring how
   `Materials.standard` declares deferred+forward.

Risk: the skin shader is also used by fbx-skin / hello-skin (forward pipeline) -- adding an unused
`fs_gbuffer` entry is additive and must not change their forward rendering. Must re-run the skin
smokes (hello/skin, hello/fbx-skin, hello/character) + dawn + browser after the change.

---

## [FALSIFIED — superseded by §"D1 + D5 ROOT CAUSE" above] D1 PIVOT: skin-root SCALE breaking the palette
> Also WRONG: skinning/palette are correct at every scale; the real cause is ground-plane occlusion. Investigation record only.

The previous deep-dive assumed this app runs **HDRP deferred**. It does NOT. The collectathon
boots via `createApp`, which installs **URP** by default (`createRenderer.ts:1807` installs
`URP_PIPELINE_ID`); nothing calls `installPipeline(HDRP)`. Confirmed at runtime: `__forgeaxSwapChainFormat`
present, no HDRP install, URP main pass selects `{LightMode:['Forward']}` (`urp-pipeline.ts:345`).
So the skin always renders through `fs_main` (forward) regardless of `passKind` — the `fs_gbuffer`
work is **inactive on this app** (harmless, additive; keep or revert later).

### Evidence collected (layered, real browser, ?debug=0)
- Skin entity (ent 27) has Skin + MeshRenderer + MeshFilter; draws **~10k frames** (`__skinDbg.drawn`),
  only 1-2 warmup skips. NOT a skip-draw.
- `renderer.onError` buffer (`__rerr`): **0 routed errors**. No SkinMaterialMismatch, no PSO build error.
- Reference `apps/hello/fbx-skin` (same humanoid.fbx, same engine build, URP) renders the 3 skinned
  humanoids **perfectly**. So engine + asset + URP skin path are all fine.
- Removing the collectathon's material override (use cooker-default Forward-only material) → **still invisible**.
  => material/g-buffer is NOT the cause.
- Joint world positions at scale 1/90 are correct human-scale (y up to ~1.76, near the KCC capsule),
  squarely inside the camera frustum (cam at (0, 5.8, 9), near .1 far 200, looking at origin).
- `frustumCulled:0` on the skin → still invisible. NOT culling.
- **Scale bracket (decisive):**
  - sceneRoot scale = 1     → screen goes FULLY BLACK
  - sceneRoot scale = 1/30  → invisible (only Portal + its shadow)
  - sceneRoot scale = 1/90  → invisible (only Portal + its shadow)

### Root cause
The skinned mesh is positioned by the **joint palette** `M_i = jointWorld_i * IBM_i`
(`skin-palette-allocator.ts`), and `vs_main` uses `skinnedLocal = M * pos` directly (NO node-transform
left-multiply — by design, see the skin WGSL comment). The **IBM is baked at FBX import in the
unscaled bind pose (cm space)**. The collectathon parents the FBX scene root under the KCC body AND
**scales that root by 1/90** (`spawn-player.ts:159` `FBX_CM_TO_WORLD_SCALE`). That 1/90 scale flows
into every `jointWorld_i` via `propagateTransforms`/ChildOf, but the IBM still inverts the *unscaled*
bind pose. So `jointWorld(scaled) * IBM(unscaled)` is NOT identity at bind — it bakes a residual
`1/90` scale into the skinned vertices. The cm-space local verts (~150 units) get multiplied to
~150/90 ≈ 1.7 *but also collapsed* by the mismatch, so the visible mesh shrinks to ~cm size →
invisible. At scale=1 the residual is 1 → mesh is full cm-size (~150 units) → engulfs the camera → black.
The shadow blob we saw earlier is the **shadow-caster**, which DOES use the node transform
(`shadow_caster.wgsl` uses `meshes[0].worldFromLocal`, no skinning) and so tracks the node scale.

That's why the reference (no root scale) works and the collectathon (root scaled 1/90) does not:
**you cannot scale a skinned mesh by scaling its scene root when the IBM was baked unscaled.**

### Fix direction (next)
Do NOT scale the skin scene root. Options, pick the engine-correct one:
- (A) Apply the cm->world scale at IMPORT (bake it into mesh verts + IBM + joint local transforms so
  the palette stays self-consistent) — engine-side, benefits every FBX consumer. Most correct.
- (B) Keep the FBX in cm space and parent it under a KCC body that itself carries the scale, but
  ensure the skinning is scale-consistent (jointWorld and IBM in the SAME space). Needs verifying
  whether propagateTransforms applying a uniform scale to BOTH the joints and the (baked) bind keeps
  M = jointWorld*IBM correct — it does NOT today because IBM is frozen at import.
- (C) Scale the mesh in a skin-aware way: the engine could fold a uniform "skin import scale" into
  the palette write (multiply jointWorld by the inverse bind scale), but that's a band-aid.

Leaning (A) — bake scale at import — but that's an engine change in `packages/fbx` + cooker and needs
fresh user authorization. Confirm with the user before editing.

### Debug instrumentation still in tree (REMOVE before finalize)
- `apps/collectathon/src/main.ts`: `renderer.onError` writes `globalThis.__rerr` (was a no-op swallow).
- `packages/runtime/src/render-system-record.ts`: `__skinDbg` counters around the skin draw branch.
- `apps/collectathon/src/spawn/spawn-player.ts`: `frustumCulled:0` + emissive magenta DBG params + the
  two-pass (deferred+forward) material (the deferred pass is inactive under URP — decide keep/revert).

## [FALSIFIED — superseded by §"D1 + D5 ROOT CAUSE" above] D1 UPDATE 2: "collapse" theory disproved
> Correctly disproved the scale theory but did not yet find the real cause (ground occlusion). Investigation record only.

Ran a **giant test**: sceneRoot scale=1 + camera pulled WAY back (eye y=120 z=300, far=2000).
Result: a **pixel-perfect cyan humanoid in a clean running pose** renders (screenshot
`page-2026-06-27T19-26-49-097Z.png`). So the skinning math is 100% correct and the mesh renders
fine — the earlier "1/90 collapses the mesh" explanation is WRONG.

Scale sweep (joint maxY measured at runtime; tracks **S^1**, not S^2):
| root scale | joint maxY (world) | normal cam (eye 5,9) | far cam |
|:--|:--|:--|:--|
| 1     | ~157  | BLACK (157m char engulfs near plane) | clean giant humanoid ✓ |
| 1/9   | 17.5  | invisible (17m engulfs)              | giant humanoid, offset above ground ✓ |
| 1/30  | ~5.2  | invisible                             | (not shot) |
| 1/90  | 1.76  | invisible                             | (not shot) |

So joints scale S^1 (cm·150·scale) as expected, and the rendered mesh DOES track that — visible
whenever the camera is far enough. The paradox: at 1/90 the char is correctly ~1.7m, its centroid
is **(-0.54, 1.06, -2.0)**, **12 units along the camera forward**, well inside near .1 / far 200,
`__skinDbg.drawn` ~3400/frame, **0 routed errors** — yet ZERO visible pixels (debug overlay shows the
green KCC sphere + red guardian spheres but NO character mesh at all; even the humanoid shadow is gone
now — the only shadow is the Portal's).

### What is NOT the cause (all falsified)
material/g-buffer · HDRP (app is URP) · frustum cull (`frustumCulled:0` no change) ·
skip-draw (draws every frame) · routed errors (none) · skinning math (giant test perfect) ·
placement (centroid 12u in front of camera, in frustum).

### Open hypotheses (need engine-level instrumentation next)
- A **scale-dependent** issue in the skin draw at small uniform scale: e.g. the mesh SSBO
  `worldFromLocal` written for the skin entity is near-singular at 1/90 and something (depth range?
  winding from negative-ish determinant? a normalize? backface/again) drops the fragments — even
  though `vs_main` claims to use only the palette. The fact that it's visible at large scale and
  invisible at small scale, with identical palette math, points at a *scale-coupled* term in the
  actual composed shader or the SSBO path, NOT the palette.
- Worth dumping: the actual `meshes[0].worldFromLocal` the record stage writes for the skin entity at
  1/90 (determinant / scale), and the **composed** skin `vs_main` the dev server serves (does it
  multiply by the node world anywhere?). Also try: skin with scale=1/90 but camera framed for a small
  char (eye ~1.5,4) to see if it's purely off-screen vs truly unrendered (one shot at eye 6,12 went
  black due to a state change/timer — inconclusive, redo without the timer running out).

### Engine-edit scope check (for the user)
The two D1 engine edits already made (`packages/shader/default-standard-pbr-skin.wgsl` fs_gbuffer +
`render-system-record.ts` __skinDbg counters) are INACTIVE on this URP app — the fs_gbuffer is
additive/harmless, the counters are debug-only. Neither fixes D1. The real fix likely needs a
**different** engine change once the scale-coupled cause is isolated — fresh authorization point.

> NOTE: the above falsified trail is superseded — D1 was the ground-wall occlusion (see top
> banner). The scale paradox was a measurement confound (camera aimed at the wrong place while
> the wall hid the char). All of those engine debug edits were reverted; the file is back to HEAD.

## ENGINE FIXES (2026-06-28, user-authorized) + D2/D3 NUMERIC DIAGNOSIS

### Engine fix #1 — multi-KCC sensor jam (`packages/physics-rapier3d`)
`computeColliderMovement` was called without `EXCLUDE_SENSORS`, so a guardian attack **sensor**
overlapping the player was treated as a solid obstacle and the KCC refused to move. Fix: pass
`RAPIER.QueryFilterFlags.EXCLUDE_SENSORS`. Regression test added (two KCCs coexist; overlapping
sensor does not jam). 42 physics tests green.

### Engine fix #2 — scoped SceneInstance teardown orphans deep members (`packages/state`)
**This was the real root cause behind the "stuck character" cluster (much of D2/D3 + D6).**

Chain: 3 guardians kill the player in ~3s → `Play -> Title -> Play` **replay**. On Play exit,
`transitionStatesSystem.scopeDespawn` plain-`world.despawn`'d the player's `sceneRoot` (a
`SceneInstance`). `ChildOf` ships `linkedSpawn: true` but the cascade is **intentionally one level
deep** (`world.ts _despawnCore` passes `internal=true` to child despawns, so grandchildren are not
collected). The humanoid FBX rig is many levels deep (root → Armature → Hips → Spine → …), so every
member below depth 1 **orphaned** with a stale `ChildOf -> (sceneRoot, gen0)`. On replay the
sceneRoot index was reused at gen1, so `propagateTransforms.resolveEntity` could not find the
parent in its live-map and threw `RhiError hierarchy-broken` **~2×/frame, forever**. Effects:
- aborts `propagateTransforms` mid-pass → skeleton world mats never derived → **frozen/detached rig
  (looked like D2/D3)**;
- the throw also stalled the system schedule → **player-move + core-collect didn't run** → player
  couldn't move and couldn't collect (**looked like D6**).

Fix (`packages/state/src/transition-system.ts`): in `scopeDespawn`, route any scoped entity that
carries `SceneInstance` (resolved by name via the global registry — state keeps zero runtime dep)
through `world.despawnScene(e)` (a fully-recursive `iterDescendants` teardown) **before** the plain
`world.despawn` loop. Ordering matters: the sceneRoot is often `ChildOf` a scoped KCC body, and
despawning that body first would invalidate the root handle before it could be cascaded. 2 new
regression tests + 1 stale m5w1 assertion updated (a grandchild now correctly despawns). 137 state
tests green.

Measured: browser `hierarchy-broken` count went **196/frame → 0** across multiple replays.

### D6 (props uncollectable) — FIXED (`apps/collectathon/src/spawn/spawn-player.ts`)
Two app-side bugs on the player parent spawn, on top of the engine schedule stall above:
1. collider `collisionGroups` defaulted to **0** (membership 0 / filter 0) → under Rapier's rule
   `(A.membership & B.filter) && (B.membership & A.filter)` the player overlapped **nothing**; no
   Core/Guardian/Portal sensor ever registered. Fix: `collisionGroups: PLAYER_GROUPS`.
2. the player parent had **no `CollidingEntities` component** → `writebackCollidingEntities` skips
   entities lacking it → every `world.get(player, CollidingEntities)` returned `{ok:false}` →
   core-collect / guardian-hit / portal-activate / win-lose all silently no-op'd. Fix: spawn it
   `{ entities: [] }`. (The duplicate `collisionGroups` set previously in main.ts was removed; SSOT
   is now spawn-player.)
Verified numerically: walked the player onto the core at (3,-5) → **SCORE 0/12 → 1/12**; HEALTH
also decrements when a guardian hits → guardian-hit path confirmed live too.

### D2 / D3 — root-caused with numeric proof (still OPEN, app-side, no fix yet)
Camera follows the player, so screenshots can't show motion/facing/animation. Verified via a
temporary `window.__cgProbe` (since removed) sampled over time with `?noguard=1`:

| Check | Sampled data | Verdict |
|:--|:--|:--|
| translation (hold W) | z: 0 → -0.67 → -4.66 → -8.73 → -12.34 → -14.69 (stops at wall) | ✅ moves |
| strafe (hold D, cam looks -Z) | x: 0 → +4.0, z unchanged | ✅ D7 correct |
| locomotion crossfade | weights `[0,1]` → `[0.56,0.44]` → `[1,0]` | ✅ blends |
| skeleton animating | joint-0 world pos changes frame-to-frame, tracks player | ✅ plays |
| **D2 facing** | `quatY=0, quatW=1` the **entire** run — parent never yaws | ❌ broken |
| **D2 idle** | idle slot = run clip at `speeds=[1,0]` → frozen mid-stride; j0 world const at rest | ❌ broken |
| **D3 offset** | idle: j0 world z = **-2.83** while player z = **0** (run-clip root motion) | ❌ broken |

Planned fixes (app-side): D2(a) write a yaw quat in `player-move` from the planar move direction;
D2(b) source a real idle clip or accept the frozen-run placeholder; D3 strip/zero the run clip's
root-motion translation channel (or compensate the sceneRoot local offset).

## TASK #19 — guardians kill in ~3s + no-camera replay flash (DONE 2026-06-28)

Both halves were diagnosed by the agent **from the running game** (DEV `window.__cg` hook +
fixed-camera screenshots + a temporary `window.__cg.guardians()` introspector, since removed).

### Engine fix #3 — ChildOf kinematic colliders pinned at the world origin (`packages/physics-rapier3d`)
**The "guardians kill in ~3s" half was NOT a tuning issue — it was a 3rd engine bug.** Live proof:
at spawn (player at origin) the player's `CollidingEntities` listed **all three** guardian attack
sensors at once, while those sensors' ECS `GlobalTransform.world` correctly showed them 7-13m away at
their bodies. Once the player roamed off-origin, an armed guardian could close to **0.93m** and
still register **zero** overlap.

Root cause: `rapier-physics-world-3d.ts` `physicsSyncBackend` kinematic mirror fed the **local**
`Transform.pos` to `setKinematicPosition`. A `ChildOf` collider (the attack sensor, local pos
`(0,0,0)`) therefore had its Rapier collider **pinned at the world origin forever** — only its ECS
Transform followed the parent (via `propagateTransforms`). This single bug caused BOTH #19 symptoms:
spawn-camp kills (player sits on the stuck sensors) + un-hittable chasers (sensors never leave
origin). Fix: drive the kinematic mirror from `GlobalTransform.world` translation (column-major mat4
elements 12/13/14) instead of local pos; physics runs `after: propagateTransforms`, so the world
column is fresh. New regression test (a ChildOf kinematic sensor overlaps a probe at the parent
world pos, not the origin); the pre-existing AC-10a test now registers `propagateTransforms` (which
`createApp` always does). 43 physics tests green; hello/physics + hello/character smokes PASS.

### App fix — camera hoisted to app-lifetime (`apps/collectathon/src/main.ts`)
The camera was spawned in Play `OnEnter` and `despawnOnExit`-scoped, so a `Win/Lose -> Title -> Play`
replay (two deferred `setNextState` frames, F-08) despawned it on Play exit and didn't respawn it
until Play re-entered → the unconditional frame-loop draw hit `render-system-no-camera` for the
in-between frames (a black flash). The boot pump only fixes the FIRST entry (runs before
`app.start()`, can't re-pump mid-loop). Fix: spawn the camera ONCE in `bootstrap` (like the
app-lifetime audio emitters) and pass it into `wireStates`; it is no longer in the Play despawn set,
so it survives every replay. `player-move.followCamera` re-aims it at the fresh player each run.

### Guardian opening tuning (still kept, now for fairness not as a workaround)
Even with the engine bug fixed, the original guardian spawns (dist 7.28/7.28/8.0 from origin) with
`CHASE_RADIUS=8` would aggro all three on frame 1 — a real spawn-camp. So `CHASE_RADIUS` is now 5
and `GUARDIAN_SPAWNS` are pushed out (closest patrol approaches 9.22/9.22/7.0, all > 5). The opening
is calm; guardians engage the moment the player roams within 5m, and **still kill** (verified live:
idle at spawn held HEALTH 3 for 30s+; roaming into a guardian dropped HEALTH 3 → 2 → 1).

### Live verification (agent-judged, user did not need to look)
- spawn idle 30s+: HEALTH stays 3, TIME climbs (no spawn-camp, no death-replay loop);
- roam into a guardian: HEALTH drops on contact (guardians have teeth);
- death-triggered `Play->Lose->Title->Play` replay: `cameraCount=1` throughout, camera back at
  follow pose, **no `render-system-no-camera` / `hierarchy-broken` / `RhiError`** in console;
- `playerColliding` at spawn went `[114,118,116]` → `[]` (sensors now follow their bodies).

### Status of the change set (uncommitted)
`apps/collectathon/{main,spawn/spawn-guardian,spawn/spawn-level,spawn/spawn-player,systems/guardian-ai,systems/player-move}.ts`
(+player-move test, +smoke-dawn replica), `packages/physics-rapier3d` (+regression test),
`packages/state` (+test). All debug probes removed; trees clean. Gates green: 83 collectathon + 137
state + 43 physics unit tests, collectathon/physics/character dawn smokes PASS (300 frames,
RhiError=0), typecheck + biome clean. Nothing committed yet.
