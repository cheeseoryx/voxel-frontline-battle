# Multithreaded execution reference

Production browser reference for the Web/TypeScript execution tiers. It keeps World, Renderer, and WebGPU co-located in the Engine Worker and uses a persistent Kernel Worker pool only for eligible shared numeric `QuerySpan` work.

## Run

```bash
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-multithreaded-execution dev
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-multithreaded-execution smoke:browser
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-multithreaded-execution gauntlet
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-multithreaded-execution bench:production
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-multithreaded-execution m0
```

The Vite server and preview send `COOP: same-origin` and `COEP: require-corp`. Open `/?tier=engine-worker`, `/?tier=shared`, or `/?tier=shared&fault=1`. The fault route performs one possible partial write, stops simulation, exposes `shared-kernel-failed`, and allows explicit rebuild to a fresh World identity.

`gauntlet` is the independent Engine Gauntlet scenario. It drives the public App/ECS surfaces through the main-serial, engine-worker, and shared tiers, captures Host input/update/frame-credit/render evidence, forces the shared partial-write poison path, rebuilds through `app.execution.rebuild()`, and records cleanup order plus the second-stop `app-not-started` no-op. It also runs the explicit unavailable-tier path and requires the structured refusal to report `actualTier: null` rather than silently falling back.

The gauntlet-only Mesh/Camera/Light witnesses are created when telemetry is requested; the default smoke and production benchmark retain the lightweight particle workload while the gauntlet keeps its real rendering evidence.

## Evidence gates

| Command | Proves | Threshold |
|:--|:--|--:|
| `m0` | Real response headers, Worker capability matrix, and raw SAB Kernel speedup | Shared p50 speedup >= 1.5x |
| `smoke:browser` | Real production bundle, both Worker tiers, shared dispatch, poison freeze, falsification, and rebuild | All structural assertions pass |
| `gauntlet` | Independent semantic/live/GPU/behavioral/recovery evidence, including capability truth and idempotent cleanup | Prints `M12_EXECUTION_POISON_REBUILD_PASS` |
| `bench:production` | Same Engine Worker and workload with forced-inline versus shared raw Host-frame samples, measured in two alternating treatment-order rounds | A qualified runner and a 95% confidence interval lower bound for p95 improvement >= 15% |

The benchmark uses 65,536 rows, 96 iterations per row, 20 warmup frames, and 240 retained samples per tier per round. It alternates the forced-inline and shared treatments in both orders to keep the p95 comparison inside the same scheduler/thermal epochs. It reads end-to-end `host-frame` durations from the App-owned bounded Profiler capture, retains presentation cadence as secondary evidence, and writes raw samples, distribution summaries, order metadata, pause evidence, and a deterministic 95% bootstrap interval to the active closed-loop evidence directory. Before accepting the verdict it compares the browser's `hardwareConcurrency` with the Node cgroup capacity; a material mismatch is recorded as `runner-unqualified` and fails closed. An isolated host pause (at least 250 ms and 10x the tier p95) is recorded as runner-instability evidence and gets one bounded fresh-process retry; sustained slow frames still fail the product verdict.
