/**
 * Closed union of recover() error codes.
 *
 * Exactly 4 members (feat-20260622-s5 M3 / D-2 add-only minor; the S3
 * skeleton shipped the first two):
 *   - `'recover-not-needed'` — health state is `'alive'`, no recovery required
 *     (also returned after a successful recover: the renderer is alive again,
 *     so a second recover() is a no-op signal — A-AC-08 idempotency)
 *   - `'recover-not-implemented'` — **reserved**. The S3 skeleton returned this
 *     for each degraded state; M3 implements recover() so this code is no longer
 *     produced. Kept in the union (not deleted) so consumers' exhaustive
 *     switches stay valid — AGENTS.md Change stance: `*ErrorCode` unions evolve
 *     add-only minor, never remove a member
 *   - `'recover-adapter-unavailable'` — rebuild requested a new adapter but
 *     `requestAdapter` returned no adapter (driver / GPU may have been reset)
 *   - `'recover-device-unavailable'` — an adapter was obtained but
 *     `requestDevice` failed or threw (device creation is driver-dependent)
 *
 * On both failure codes the health state stays `'device-lost'` (recover() never
 * fakes the renderer back to `'alive'` on failure — A-AC-07). recover() is a
 * single idempotent attempt: no retry loop, no backoff, no timer (A-OOS-1).
 *
 * AI users exhaustively switch without default; TS guards completeness.
