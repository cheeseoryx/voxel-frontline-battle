// @forgeax/engine-rhi-null/src/bookkeeping - method-A handle ledger for the
// headless no-op backend.
//
// RhiNull issues legal opaque-handle brands (each RHI brand is a compile-time
// `unique symbol` with no runtime field, so any plain object cast via
// `as unknown as Buffer` satisfies the type contract; research Finding A6). To
// let M3 command-stream assertions read back create/destroy pairing, draw /
// dispatch counts and binding assembly, RhiNull threads each issued handle
// through a per-device Bookkeeper that records a numeric id + kind + destroyed
// flag + the issuing device id.
//
// Error contract (plan-strategy D-1): handle-chain inconsistencies reuse the
// existing closed RhiErrorCode union with ZERO new members:
//   - a handle observed on a device other than its issuer -> 'rhi-not-available'
//   - a destroy / use observed on an already-destroyed handle ->
//     'destroy-after-destroy'
// Every RhiError carries the required code / expected / hint triple
// (charter proposition 3 structured failure).
//
// Related: requirements AC-09 (foreign handle returns structured err, no silent
// pass); plan-strategy §2 D-1; research Finding A3 (RhiErrorCode 20 members,
// 'rhi-not-available' at errors.ts:113, 'destroy-after-destroy' at errors.ts:127)
// + Finding A6 (brand construction); charter P3.
