// @forgeax/engine-ecs - UniqueRefStore.
//
// Per-slot singleton store for ECS-managed asset handles. Schema vocab
// `ref<T>` fields derive `Handle<T, 'unique'>` whose lifecycle is owned by
// the ECS - World hooks `despawn` / `removeComponent` / `set` into
// `UniqueRefStore.release` so dropping a holder entity reliably releases the
// referenced asset slot. AssetRegistry handles (`handle<T>` schema vocab) take
// the orthogonal `'shared'` mode and never enter this store.
//
// §contract — handles carry a generation; stale-by-reuse is detected
//   The handle u32 packs `(generation << 24) | slot` via the shared codec in
//   `@forgeax/engine-types` (the same SSOT codec ECS `EntityHandle` uses). The
//   slot occupies the low 24 bits (capped at MAX_SLOT == ENTITY_MAX_INDEX);
//   the generation occupies the high 8 bits. `alloc` welds the slot's current
//   generation into the returned handle; `resolve` / `release` compare the
//   handle's generation against the store's `_generations[slot]` BEFORE any
//   payload work, so a handle whose slot was released and re-allocated is
//   caught deterministically and returns `UniqueRefStaleError` ('unique-ref-
//   stale') — it no longer silently resolves to the next payload.
//
//   Generation advances on release and retires the slot when gen would exceed
//   MAX_GEN (255) — gen 255 is still usable; the bump to 256 triggers retire —
//   rather than wrapping, so a re-used slot can never collide with an old
//   handle's generation (mirrors EntityHandle via the isRetiredSlot SSOT).
//
//   AC-06 (unique-ref-double-release) remains payload-presence detected
//   (`payloads.has(raw)`) for a handle whose generation still matches; the
//   generation check catches the orthogonal stale-by-reuse case first.
//
// Storage shape:
//   - `payloads: Map<number, unknown>` - key = handle u32 = slot index.
//                                    Strong reference; deleted on release.
//                                    Type-erased (the store never inspects
//                                    payload fields); `Handle<T, 'unique'>`
//                                    carries `T` at the type level and the
//                                    single read site (World.get's ref path)
//                                    narrows `unknown -> T` at the boundary.
//   - `freeSlots: number[]`        - LIFO stack of recyclable slot indices.
//   - `releaseCallbacks: Map<...>` - per-slot onRelease cb cleared before fire.
//   - `nextSlot`                   - bump counter for the never-recycled tail.
//
// 24 bits = 16_777_215 simultaneous live managed handles - the same ceiling
// as Entity, so an ECS that hit the entity ceiling cannot grow past the
// managed-ref ceiling either. Ceiling-exhaust handling is a future concern;
// the store deliberately panics on overflow to fail fast rather than
// silently wrap.
//
// Release path (D-1 codes):
//   - resolve(h):  err(UniqueRefReleasedError)        if payload absent.
//   - release(h):  err(UniqueRefDoubleReleaseError)   on second release.
//
// Object.is identity invariant (AC-04 prelude):
//   resolve(h) returns the SAME payload object on every call until release
//   - the store does not clone, wrap, or proxy the payload. M4 carry-over
//   reuses this invariant: archetype migrate moves the row index, not the
//   payload reference, so wrapper identity survives migration.

/**
 * Per-slot singleton store for ECS-managed `Handle<T, 'unique'>` lifecycles.
 * World hooks the three release paths (despawn, removeComponent, set) into
 * `release(handle)`; `resolve(handle)` is the read path AI users reach
 * indirectly through `world.get(e, C)` for `ref<T>` schema fields.
 *
 * §contract — handles carry a generation; stale-by-reuse is detected: the
 * handle u32 packs `(gen << 24) | slot` via the shared codec; `resolve` /
 * `release` compare the handle generation against `_generations[slot]` and
 * return `UniqueRefStaleError` ('unique-ref-stale') when a released slot has
 * been re-allocated, instead of silently resolving to the next payload.
 * README §"Managed handles carry a generation" is the canonical AI-user-
 * facing statement.
 *
 * Identity invariant (AC-04 prelude): the payload returned by `resolve` is
 * the same object reference on every call until `release`. Carry-over (M4)
 * relies on this - archetype migrate moves the row index, not the payload.
 *
 * Storage is type-erased (`unknown`): the store routes lifecycle without ever
 * inspecting payload fields. Per-call payload typing flows through method
 * generics: `alloc<T>` accepts a `T` payload + matching `onRelease(T)`, and
 * `resolve<T>` returns `Result<T, ...>`. Both narrow at the call boundary
 * (the single read site is World.get's ref path); making the class generic
 * on `T` was decoration with no internal use, so the parameter was dropped
 * (architecture-principles.md §1 SSOT).
