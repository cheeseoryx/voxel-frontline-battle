# @forgeax/engine-picking

Screen-to-entity, vertex-level, and tile-cell picking as free functions. Tier 2.2
package extracted from `@forgeax/engine-runtime`
(feat-20260705-runtime-tier2-decomposition M2) so an AI user loads only the
picking concept surface — not the whole renderer — when the task is "turn a
screen coordinate into an entity / vertex / tile". First runtime-downstream
engine package: `@forgeax/engine-picking` depends on `@forgeax/engine-runtime`,
never the reverse.

## 30-second self-introduction

- **`pick(world, cameraEntity, screenX, screenY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight)`**
  — unprojects a viewport-relative screen coordinate into a world-space ray
  through the camera, walks every renderable archetype, ray-AABB tests each
  pickable mesh's world-space bounding box, and returns the nearest
  `PickHit { entity, point, distance }` (or `undefined` on a miss). AABB
  granularity (Three.js `Raycaster`-aligned MVP; per-triangle precision is
  `pickVertex`).
- **`viewportToWorld(world, cameraEntity, screenX, screenY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight)`**
  — exposes the same camera unprojection as a world-space `Ray` for cursor
  placement, gizmos, and custom plane/triangle queries.
- **`pickVertexOnEntity` / `pickVertex`** — per-triangle vertex-level queries
  (editor vertex-snapping workflow). Three-state static-dispatch overload:
  without options -> `VertexHit | undefined`; with `{ limit: N }` -> `VertexHit[]`
  sorted by `screenDist`. `pickVertexOnEntity` queries one entity; `pickVertex`
  walks the whole scene (AABB coarse cull, then per-entity vertex collect).
- **`pickTile(world, tilemapEntity, worldX, worldY)`** — cell-level Tilemap query:
  converts world coordinates through the full inverse of the propagated
  `GlobalTransform.world` affine matrix, walks child `TileLayer`s in descending
  `layerOrder`, and returns `Result.ok(PickTileHit { layerEntity, cellX, cellY,
  tileId })` for the topmost non-zero cell, `Result.ok(null)` for empty /
  out-of-bounds, or `Result.err(PickTileError)` for a structural break.
- **`PickError` / `PickErrorCode`** — closed single-member error union
  (`'camera-component-missing'`); the SSOT for the picking error surface. A
  `cameraEntity` without a `Camera` component throws `PickError`; ordinary "ray
  hit nothing" outcomes return `undefined` / `[]` (error channel physically
  separated from the miss channel, charter P3).
- **`pick-core`** (internal) — the shared skeleton (camera validation ->
  `view = invert(GlobalTransform.world)` -> projection branch -> `screenToRay` ->
  `readWorldMatrix`) that `pick` and `pickVertex*` both consume. Single source of
  truth (architecture-principles §2); the AI user never imports it directly.

### 30s hands-on example

```ts
import { pick, type PickHit } from '@forgeax/engine-picking';
import { MeshRenderer } from '@forgeax/engine-render';
import { propagateTransforms } from '@forgeax/engine-scene';

// Caller resolves GlobalTransform.world for the current frame first (D-9 contract):
propagateTransforms(world);

const hit: PickHit | undefined = pick(
  world,
  cameraEntity,
  pointerX, pointerY,        // viewport-relative, y-down, top-left origin
  canvas.width, canvas.height,
);
if (hit) {
  // hit.entity: the picked EntityHandle; hit.point: world-space AABB entry;
  // hit.distance: entry distance along the ray (>= 0)
  world.set(hit.entity, MeshRenderer, { materials: [highlight] });
}
```

## API surface

### Screen-to-entity (`pick`)

| Function | Signature | Return |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `pick` | `(world, cameraEntity, screenX, screenY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight)` | `PickHit \| undefined` (nearest hit, or `undefined` on miss) |

`PickHit = { entity: EntityHandle; point: Vec3Like; distance: number }`. No
`face` / `uv` / `normal` — AABB picking has no triangle resolution, so those
would be a lie (use `pickVertex` for per-triangle vertices). Both `perspective`
and `orthographic` camera projections are supported. Reads the resolved
`GlobalTransform.world` mat4 directly (feat-20260601 D-3), so the camera + candidates
must have propagated transforms for the current frame.

### Screen-to-world (`viewportToWorld`)

| Function | Signature | Return |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `viewportToWorld` | `(world, cameraEntity, screenX, screenY, viewportWidth, viewportHeight)` | `Ray \| undefined` |

The returned ray uses the same top-left/y-down viewport coordinates as `pick`.
It is the low-level cursor-to-world front door: intersect it with the game
surface you own, then place an entity or debug primitive at the result.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Viewport validity** — if either viewport dimension is zero, negative,
> `NaN`, or `Infinity`, `pick`, `viewportToWorld`, `pickVertex`, and
> `pickVertexOnEntity` return their ordinary no-ray/no-hit shape (`undefined`
> or `[]`). They do not delegate an invalid viewport to a fabricated origin
> ray. Restore positive, finite dimensions and retry on the same World; the
> normal mesh, vertex, and ray results recover without rebuilding the scene.

### Vertex-level (`pickVertex` / `pickVertexOnEntity`)

| Function | Signature | Return |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `pickVertexOnEntity` | `(world, cameraEntity, screenX, screenY, vpW, vpH, entity, options?)` | Without `options`: `VertexHit \| undefined` |
| `pickVertexOnEntity` | `(..., entity, { limit })` | `VertexHit[]` (sorted by `screenDist` asc, empty on miss) |
| `pickVertex` | `(world, cameraEntity, screenX, screenY, vpW, vpH, options?)` | Without `options`: `VertexHit \| undefined` |
| `pickVertex` | `(..., { limit })` | `VertexHit[]` (globally sorted by `screenDist` asc, empty on miss) |

`VertexHit = { entity, vertexIndex, worldPos: Vec3Like, screenDist, worldDist, deformed }`.
Only `triangle-list` submeshes participate; skinned meshes report
`deformed=true` with rest-pose `worldPos`. Behind-camera vertices are excluded.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`propagateTransforms` precondition (D-9)** — call
> `propagateTransforms(world)` (exported from `@forgeax/engine-runtime`) for the
> current frame before `pick` / `pickVertex*`. These functions read
> `GlobalTransform.world` column-major mat4 directly; they never re-propagate. The
> contract is identical across `pick` and `pickVertex*`.

### Tile-cell (`pickTile`)

| Function | Signature | Return |
|:--|:--|:--|
| `pickTile` | `(world, tilemapEntity, worldX, worldY)` | `Result<PickTileHit \| null, PickTileError>` |

`PickTileHit = { layerEntity, cellX, cellY, tileId }`. Callers propagate the
World before picking so `GlobalTransform.world` is current; an entity without a
Transform retains the origin-default path. `Result.ok(null)` = empty cell or
out-of-bounds. A dead handle returns `tilemap-not-found`; a live entity without
`Tilemap` returns `tilemap-component-missing`. `PickTileError` is a closed
two-member discriminated union, runtime-local (not exported through
`@forgeax/engine-types`). Singular transforms use the shared `mat4.invert`
identity fallback deterministically, without widening the error union.

## Error model

`PickError` owns the package-local precondition code in `src/pick-errors.ts`, and
`PickErrorCode` derives from `PickError['code']`. The declaration proof at
`src/__tests__/pick-errors.test-d.ts` checks that owner relationship, the closed
surface, invalid literals, and exhaustive switching.

When the `cameraEntity` passed to `pick` or `pickVertex*` has no `Camera`
component, the functions throw `PickError`: no view/projection matrix can be
built, and the error carries `.expected`, `.hint`, and `.detail.cameraEntity`.
Attach a `Camera` with `world.set` as directed by `.hint`, then retry. Ordinary
ray misses still return `undefined` / `[]`; `PickTileError` remains a separate
two-member union returned (not thrown) through `Result`.

## Package boundary

Depends on `@forgeax/engine-runtime` (components: `Camera` / `Transform` /
`MeshFilter` / `MeshRenderer` / `ChildOf` / `TileLayer` / `Tilemap`;
`propagateTransforms`), `@forgeax/engine-assets-runtime` (`resolveAssetHandle`
for `MeshAsset.aabb`), `@forgeax/engine-ecs`, `@forgeax/engine-math`, and
`@forgeax/engine-types`. `@forgeax/engine-runtime` does **not** import this
package (no reverse edge — picking is a leaf consumer).

Visible acceptance: `apps/hello/picking` (click a cube to highlight) +
structural-only dawn-node smoke (asserts `pick` returns the expected entity + a
miss returns `undefined`).

## Source anchors

- `src/pick-vertex.ts` — `pickVertex` / `pickVertexOnEntity` + `VertexHit`
- `src/pick-tile.ts` — `pickTile` + `PickTileHit` / `PickTileError`
- `src/pick-errors.ts` — `PickError` / `PickErrorCode` (error SSOT)
