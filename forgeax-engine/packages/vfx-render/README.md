# @forgeax/engine-vfx-render

Production RenderFeature and host for persistent GPU particle simulation and indirect billboard, mesh, ribbon, trail, and beam drawing.

## Host recipe

```ts
import { createVfxRuntimeHost } from '@forgeax/engine-vfx-render';
import { createRenderer } from '@forgeax/engine-runtime';

const vfx = createVfxRuntimeHost({
  camera: {
    read: world => readActiveParticleCamera(world),
  },
  maxQueuedTicks: 8,
});

const attached = await vfx.attachWorld({ world, assets });
if (!attached.ok) return attached;

const created = await createRenderer(canvas, { features: [vfx.feature] });
if (!created.ok) throw created.error;
const renderer = created.value;
```

Create the host before the Renderer and pass `host.feature` at Renderer
construction. `attachWorld` installs the schema-v2 Pack loader and one
FixedUpdate producer. `detachWorld` removes both the system and runtime
resource. Material and mesh GUIDs resolve through the attached World's
`AssetRegistry`.

## Frame path

| Stage | Work |
|:--|:--|
| Extract | Read camera and ordered GPU tick intents from each attached World |
| Plan | Declare program, particle, scan, indirect, per-tick uniform, per-renderer projection, mesh, and graphics resources |
| Record | Compile the plan into spawn/update/scan/compact dispatches, then dependent indirect draws |
| Recover | Drop generation-owned GPU state and restart affected runtime players |
| Dispose | Release feature-owned state; the Renderer resolver destroys RHI resources exactly once |

The generic render seam accepts persistent compute programs/buffers/bindings, external GPU vertex buffers, and indirect draw commands. Renderer code does not enumerate VFX kinds.

## GPU state

| Buffer | Lifetime | CPU traffic |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Particle state | Emitter instance | Initial clear only |
| Alive flags, scan scratch, stable indices | Emitter instance | Initial clear only |
| Indirect commands | Emitter instance | Static geometry fields at creation; instance count on GPU |
| Tick uniforms | Bounded ring | One small write per fixed tick |
| Renderer projection instances | Renderer instance | None after allocation |
| Mesh geometry/index data | Prepared graphics cache | Initial upload |
| Ribbon strip resources | Ribbon renderer | Initial allocation; GPU indirect count |
| Trail history resources | Trail renderer | Initial allocation; GPU history updates |
| Beam endpoint resources | Beam renderer | Initial allocation; GPU endpoint projection |

There is no steady-state particle readback or CPU particle upload.
Bindings retained by an attached player keep their transitive buffers alive. When a player,
emitter, or World disappears, untouched GPU resources leave the live cache immediately and their
buffers are destroyed only after the submitted queue work completes. Renderer recovery and dispose
use the same owner path.

## Rendering

- Billboard projection uses camera right/up, particle width/height, and `size_rotation.z`; color and HDR material values are packed per renderer on GPU.
- Mesh renderers consume the explicitly selected `MeshAsset` submesh geometry/index data and one independent projected instance stream per renderer.
- Multiple renderers on one emitter receive independent material values and indirect command offsets.
- A material pass named `particle-billboard` or `particle-mesh` selects that renderer's authored
  shader module and render state. Ordinary `Forward` passes are ignored because their vertex layout
  is not a particle projection contract; absence of a matching particle pass uses the package-owned
  built-in shader.
- A custom particle material with a non-empty `parameters` schema receives the standard material
  bind group at group 1. Numeric parameters are uploaded through the shader-schema UBO layout;
  texture parameters resolve their authored TextureAsset and optional SamplerAsset through the
  attached World and the renderer's shared GPU residency store. Materials with no parameters keep
  the original group-0-only contract.
- The renderer owns bind-group resource leases. Per-preparation material UBOs are destroyed exactly
  once when the prepared graphics generation retires or recovers; texture and sampler residency
  remains owned by the shared GPU resource store.
- Billboard blend is explicit: `additive`, premultiplied `alpha`, or `opaque-cutout`.
- Scene color/depth target formats and sample counts derive from RenderFeature targets.
- Fixed bounds cull projection/draw before graph contribution; simulation follows the source culling policy.
- Camera-frustum results publish through `setEmitterCameraVisibility`; session mute/isolate is a separate mask that suppresses compute and draw contribution while retaining prepared bindings as warm state. A paused player can therefore be isolated and restored without a new simulation intent or GPU-resource reallocation.
- WGSL runtime time is the effect-relative `phaseTick`; the world-global tick remains an internal ring-selection and correlation clock. Replay and deterministic seek therefore restart shader time as well as CPU scheduling.

Billboard texture sheets, pivot, soft-particle depth sampling, and sorting are
executed from the reflected renderer contract. Ribbon, trail, and beam use
independent resource plans and shader entry points. Parent variants and CPU
counterparts remain outside this runtime boundary.

Material texture and sampler bindings remain executable for particle materials;
the advanced renderer fields augment that shared material path.

## Runtime inspection

`host.inspect(world)` returns one immutable aggregate for the attached world:

| Field | Meaning |
|:--|:--|
| `generation` | Host attachment generation; changes when a new World realm is attached |
| `players[]` | Keyed per-player snapshots, including every emitter rather than one latest intent |
| `diagnostics[]` | Runtime-owned structured diagnostics for the same world |

The aggregate is `undefined` for an unattached World. A freshly attached empty
World returns an explicit empty aggregate, which lets tools distinguish “ready,
no player” from “not attached.” Realm-local entity handles are never reused as
cross-World identity; consumers must pair them with the host generation and
asset GUID.

`host.acquireControl(world)` is the command-side counterpart to inspection. It
returns a generation-bound lease for replay and runtime-only emitter session
masks, so product hosts do not reach through the public host into
`VFX_GPU_RUNTIME_RESOURCE_KEY`. Every command revalidates the attachment
generation, runtime resource and live `ParticleEffectPlayer`; detach,
reattach, or player destruction therefore returns a structured
`VfxRuntimeHostControlError` instead of mutating a stale realm. Acquire a new
lease after any host generation change. These controls are transient runtime
intent and do not modify authored `ParticleEffectPlayer` data.

`createVfxRenderInspectSnapshot` and `topologyRecoveryHint` expose structured
readiness and recovery evidence. Device loss or a stale generation discards the
affected topology resources and rebuilds them from cooked reflection.

## Capabilities and recovery

The feature requires RHI `compute` and `indirectDrawing`. Capability absence disables registration through the standard RenderFeature capability error; it never guesses a backend by package name and never silently falls back to CPU.

Expected first-use pipeline preparation may report bounded `render-feature-preparation-failed` warm-up. Persistent preparation errors, WebGPU validation errors, or any later `render-feature-stage-failed` are failures. Renderer recovery creates a fresh resource generation and invokes the feature recovery hook before rendering resumes.

## Verification oracle

`apps/hello/boss-lightning` is the production path:

| Gate | Proof |
|:--|:--|
| `smoke:browser` | Dev Pack/import transport, Browser WebGPU validation, loader, runtime, camera readiness |
| `smoke` | Dawn 300 frames, billboard and mesh pixel energy, readiness deadline, explicit recovery |
| `smoke:falsify` | Disable-VFX, zero-emitter, missing-depth, and topology-fallback modes produce explicit structured failures |
| `scripts/bench/vfx-batch-b.mjs` | Exact 10K/100K/1M total capacity, 30 warm-up plus 60 sampled frames, zero particle readback, and per-adapter p95 budget |

```sh
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-boss-lightning smoke:browser
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-boss-lightning smoke
pnpm --filter @forgeax/hello-boss-lightning smoke:falsify
node apps/hello/boss-lightning/scripts/smoke-public-only.mjs
node scripts/bench/vfx-batch-b.mjs
```

The hardware product target is p95 <= 33.34 ms. CI's forced lavapipe adapter is
a software correctness reference, not evidence of hardware GPU throughput, so
its p95 is recorded but is not treated as an FPS gate. Reports include
`adapterClass`, `performanceGated`, the hardware target, and
`allocatedCapacity`. A hardware run must satisfy the target, and every tier
must allocate exactly the declared total capacity.

Null/backend unit tests prove graph and resource structure; they do not replace Browser or Dawn execution.
