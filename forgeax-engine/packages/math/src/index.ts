// @forgeax/engine-math — single-entry public API surface (D-P9 / AC-09)
//
// Shape: types SSOT top-level re-export + namespace `* as <ns>` wrappers.
//
// M1 placeholder state:
//   - types.ts seven-piece brand established (T-002);
//   - vec3 / mat4 / quat legacy implementations kept as baseline before M2 replacement;
//   - vec2 / vec4 / mat3 / quat (new) / color / euler arrive incrementally in M2~M5.
//
// Design locks (research §F-3 V8 elements-kinds + plan-strategy §K-3 SoA alignment):
//   - all numeric storage is Float32Array (types.ts brand)
//   - sideEffects: false (package.json) lets bundlers tree-shake at namespace granularity
//   - zero runtime dependencies (AC-16 + T-037 jq guard)
//
// Related: requirements §AC-09 single entry + top-level re-export;
//          plan-strategy D-P9 no sub-path + §1.1 file layering.

//   - vector family vec2 / vec3 / vec4
//   - matrix family mat3 / mat4
//   - rotation quat / euler
//   - color (sRGB↔linear + hex/CSS parse/format)
//   - easing (scalar S-curve time remaps)
//   - noise (Perlin noise, growable home for further variants)
