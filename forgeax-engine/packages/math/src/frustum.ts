 * Extract 6 frustum planes (left, right, bottom, top, near, far) from a

 *
 * Uses Gribb/Hartmann method: each plane = sum or difference of VP rows,

 * distance from origin. Plane inside-half-space is nx*x + ny*y + nz*z + d > 0.

 *

 * ```ts
 * const view = mat4.lookAt(mat4.create(), [0, 0, 5], [0, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0]);
 * const proj = mat4.perspective(mat4.create(), Math.PI / 2, 1, 0.1, 100);
 * const vp = mat4.create();
 * mat4.multiply(vp, proj, view);
