// vec3.ts — 3D vector namespace (M2 / T-014, rewritten from the M1 baseline of 8 functions)
//
// 21-function surface (≥ 18 lower bound): vec2 base (without perp) + cross + distanceSq.
//   create / clone / copy / set / equals / add / sub / scale / negate /
//   dot / cross / lengthSq / length / distance / distanceSq /
//   normalize / lerp / smoothDamp / catmullRom / min / max
//
// Cross-type transforms are provided via the reverse surfaces of mat4 / quat (K-1/K-2 tore down
// the Three.js-style promise; see plan-decisions §D-12): the three mat4 ns transform* functions
// + quat.transformVec3 supersede the historical promise to "hang cross-type methods on vec3 instances".
//
// Design locks:
//   - branded Float32Array (types.ts SSOT); factory `as Vec3` casts are funneled.
//   - The legacy local Vec3 / Vec3Like type aliases are removed; mat4 / quat now `import './types'` Vec3Like.
//   - Out-param first + aliasing-safe (gl-matrix four ironclad rules, wiki/gl-matrix-overview).
//   - normalize(0-vec) → 0-vec silent fall-back (D-P12 / AC-06).
//   - mandatory `export function` (D-P10).
//
// Related: requirements §Surface vec3 lower bound 18 + AC-19 legacy 8-function removal (vec3 portion);
//          plan-strategy §6 M2 + §1.1 vec3.ts;
//          wiki/typescript-branded-types §7.2 factory template;
//          wiki/gl-matrix-overview Out-param four ironclad rules + degenerate anchor.
//
// Compatibility: this file still re-exports `Vec3Like` from ./types so mat4 / quat's existing imports
// keep working (M2 does not force-update mat4 / quat import paths; that lands in M3).
