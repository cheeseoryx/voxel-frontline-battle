// mat4.ts — 4x4 matrix namespace (M3 / T-021 base + T-022 projection)
//
// Base functions (T-021): create / clone / identity / equals / multiply / transpose /
//   invert / scale / translate / rotate / lookAt / compose / decompose / fromQuat /
//   fromTranslation / fromScaling / fromRotation
// Projection functions (T-022): perspective / perspectiveNO / perspectiveReverseZ /
//   orthographic / orthographicNO / orthographicReverseZ
//
// Surface: 23+ functions (≥ 22 lower bound).
//
// Memory layout: column-major 16 floats (compatible with WebGL/WebGPU shader uniforms);
// index mapping m[col*4 + row]. translation lives in col 3 → indices 12, 13, 14.
//
// Naming convention (D-3):
//   - perspective / orthographic = WebGPU [0, 1] NDC (short names go to the primary target)
//   - perspectiveNO / orthographicNO = WebGL/OpenGL [-1, 1] NDC
//   - perspectiveReverseZ / orthographicReverseZ = reversed-Z (far→0, near→1)
//
// Degenerate convention:
//   - invert(singular) → out = identity (D-P1; returns out, not null)
//   - lookAt(eye=target) → out = identity (D-P17; same convention as D-P1)
//   - perspective(near>=far) / fovy<=0 / aspect<=0 → numerically undefined but does not throw
//
// Four ironclad rules (gl-matrix wiki / research §F1):
//   1. Out-param first; 2. Aliasing-safe; 3. Module-as-namespace; 4. Float32Array by default.
